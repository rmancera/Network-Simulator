This project is a graphical user interface that simulates routing network topologies.
  (1)Initially the user is presented with two windows (one where the network topology is displayed and another where the user can make changes to the network topology by filling in text boxes and pressing corresponding buttons).
  (2)Once the user has defined a desired topology, the user can select a routing algorithm (Dijkstra or Distance Vector) from teh drop down menu in one of the windows

This project contains functioning executables available for download for both Windows (.exe files) and Linux. 
The locations of these executables is:
    Network_Simulator\application.linux-arm64\ 	
    Network_Simulator\application.linux-armv6hf\
    Network_Simulator\application.linux32\ 	
    Network_Simulator\application.linux64\
    Network_Simulator\application.windows32\
    Network_Simulator\application.windows64\

This project is developed using both the programming languages Processing and Java.
This project is originaly set up for the Processing 3.3.6 integrated development environment (IDE).
To download this IDE visit https://processing.org/download/.

To set up a local programming environment simply place all of the contents of this repo in the "Processing" folder installed by the Processing IDE installer (for example, in Microsoft Windows 10 the path where the contents of this repo should go is C:\Users\User Name\Documents\Processing).

The main source code files are located in the Network_Simulator folder, see:
